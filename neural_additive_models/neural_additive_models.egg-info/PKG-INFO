## Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets

This repository contains open-source code
for the paper
[Neural Additive Models: Interpretable Machine Learning with Neural Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13912).

Currently,
we release the `tf.keras.Model` for NAM which can be simply plugged into any neural network training procedure. We also provide helpers for
building a computation graph using NAM for classification/regression problems with `tf.compat.v1`.
The `nam_train.py` file provides the example of a training script on a single
dataset split.

Use `./run.sh` test script to ensure that the setup is correct.

## Dependencies

The code was tested under Ubuntu 16 and uses these packages:

- tensorflow>=1.15
- numpy>=1.15.2
- sklearn>=0.23
- pandas>=0.24
- absl-py

developing a machine learning model to predict pre-trial detention has a
number of important ethical considerations. You can learn more about these

remediate fairness concerns in data. This dataset is canonical in the
algorithmic fairness literature.*
